      "Friends of Recovery was built on years of lived experience in long-term recovery and a shared understanding of the challenges individuals face after treatment. Our founders recognized that lasting change requires more than short-term support—it demands structure, consistent accountability, and a community that walks with people long after the early stages of sobriety.",
      "To meet this need, we brought together people from diverse professional and personal backgrounds—recovery advocates, technologists, peer mentors, and community leaders—to create a comprehensive approach that blends human connection with emerging technologies. This collaboration led to the development of the Transparency App, a tool designed to help individuals monitor their progress, strengthen principle-based living, and stay connected to meaningful support systems.",
      "Today, Friends of Recovery continues to evolve, using innovation, data-driven insights, and community partnerships to support and facilitate long-term recovery for anyone seeking a new way forward.",
